# AngelHack London 2018

Our recycling app project. The idea is to teach young people how to recycle items correctly, by using A.I. to identify the items taking a picture of them with their phones. The users are encouraged to recycle via a reward program, by means of which they cant get coupons and discounts at the affiliated shops. 
When it comes to actually dispose of the item, there is a QR code in every container, so that the user can scan it and get the rewards. 
Besides, many containers in our island (Gran Canaria) have already a fill level sensor, which could be given a second use by repurposing them to detect the user proximity to the container.

## Other functionality

The app will provide the user with a map with the location of containers and collection points for reclycling.
